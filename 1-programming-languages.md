Programming languages have to give you 2 things:

* Data (Nouns)
  * represent information
* Instructions (Verbs / functions / methods / procedures)
  * manipulate data

---

The code they use to give you these has two things:

* syntax (the structure / punctuation / grammar of the language)
* semantics (the meaning of the code)

---

Data (we'll use JSON, to make it concrete)

JSON means "JavaScript Object Notation", you can see an example [here](https://rubygems.org/api/v1/gems/rails.json).

* JSON has 6 types of data:
  * nothingness
    * `null`
  * booleans
    * `true` and `false`
  * numbers
    * `123`, `12.34`, etc
  * strings (text -- ordered collections of characters)
    * `"abc"`
  * arrays (ordered collections, accessed by position)
    * `[1, 2, 3]`
  * objects (aka hashes -- ordered collections,
    accessed by key/value -- "key" means "identifier")
    * `{"favourite_number": 12}`
